## Basics of combustion
Fire is a chemical chain reaction between a fuel and an oxidizer (usually
oxygen in the air).

For this reaction to initiate the fuel needs to be heated until the "flash point",
the temperature at which the reaction initiates. This is usually done by using
another flame, such as a match or a lighter, but there are alternative methods.

After that, the reaction needs to generate enough heat (and keep it) to ignite
the surrounding fuel, have enough oxygen, and have enough fuel. This is
not always an easy balance to achieve.

In most stoves, fireplaces and bonfires increasing the amount of oxygen means
opening air intakes, or spread logs apart to allow air circulation. But means
temperature will drop due to the passing cold air.  

**Note Carbon Dioxide (C02) and Carbon Monoxide (CO)**
Whenever fire burns with insufficient oxygen it produces carbon monoxide,
instead of the usual carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide is odorless (it might
not smell like smoke) and is toxic to animals, including humans.
Any fires burning in living spaces should be monitored.

## Firewood Tree types
The following tree species that are common in Finland, have the following
heat content per kilo, and the density.

| Tree Species  | Scientific name          | Densitiy  | Energy* (bark)  | Energy* (Stem) | Energy* (Stem+Bark) |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | --------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Pine          | Pinus Silvestris         | 510 kg/m3 |     19.53       |    19.31       |        19.33        |
| Spruce        | Picea abies              | 430 kg/m3 |     19.02       |    19.05       |        19.02        |
| Birch         | Betula pendula/pubescens | 670 kg/m3 |  22.52 / 22.27  | 18.61 / 18.68  |    19.15 / 19.19    |
