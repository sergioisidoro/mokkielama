## Basics of combustion
Fire is a chemical chain reaction between a fuel and an oxidizer (usually
oxygen in the air).

For this reaction to initiate the fuel needs to be heated until the "flash point",
the temperature at which the reaction initiates. This is usually done by using
another flame, such as a match or a lighter, but there are alternative methods.

After that, the reaction needs to generate enough heat (and keep it) to ignite
the surrounding fuel, have enough oxygen, and have enough fuel. This is
not always an easy balance to achieve.

In most stoves, fireplaces and bonfires increasing the amount of oxygen means
opening air intakes, or spread logs apart to allow air circulation. But means
temperature will drop due to the passing cold air.  

**Note Carbon Dioxide (C02) and Carbon Monoxide (CO)**
Whenever fire burns with insufficient oxygen it produces carbon monoxide,
instead of the usual carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide is odorless (it might
not smell like smoke) and is toxic to animals, including humans.
Any fires burning in living spaces should be monitored.

## Choosing Firewood and Tree species

### Type of wood
The following three tree species, the most common in Finnish forests,
have the following heat content per kilo, and density. This translates in different
amounts of energy per kilo (effort of carrying) and storage space.

| Tree Species  | Scientific name          | Densitiy  | Energy* (bark)  | Energy* (Stem) | Energy* (Stem+Bark) |  MJ/ m3 stacked wood |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | --------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Pine          | Pinus Silvestris         | 510 kg/m3 |     19.53       |    19.31       |        19.33        |     4896 – 5652      |
| Spruce        | Picea abies              | 430 kg/m3 |     19.02       |    19.05       |        19.02        |     4680 – 4752      |
| Birch         | Betula pendula/pubescens | 670 kg/m3 |  22.52 / 22.27  | 18.61 / 18.68  |    19.15 / 19.19    |     6120 – 6516      |

Birch, being extremely common, is only beaten by Ash trees, Beech, Oak and Robia tress
in terms of heat content. This makes birch the obvious choice for most people
in Finland, depending on the regional forest composition. But both Pine and Spruce
are reasonable for energy production.

### Moisture content
Moisture is obviously an enemy for igniting wood, but it also presents a major
inefficiency and waste of energy.

Freshly cut wood can have up to 60% water content, depending on the time of year the
tree has been cut down, and the species of the tree. Because water does not
burn, or contribute to combustion process, a lot of energy otherwise used in the
combustion chain reaction goes to heating and evaporating the water content of
the wood.

The ideal water content of wood for burning is bellow 20%, or ideally bellow
15%.

**You can get up to 15% more heat when burning correctly dried wood.**
That translates into 15% less cutting trees, 15% less chopping wood, and 15%
less transporting wood.


Another downside of burning moist wood, is smoldering (wood burning slowly
with smoke but no flame). This leads to accumulation of flammable residue in
the chimneys, that in worst case scenario can lead to a chimney fire


## Cutting down a Tree

### Timing
Moisture in wood is a major impediment to


## Drying
After a tree has been cut down, the moisture content of the wood is relatively
high (depending on the season the tree has been cut down, as we have seen before).
This makes combustion much difficult, and cutting the wood a very exhausting task.

In an ideal scenario, the wood from a tree should be used the following year,
after being left a summer over to dry, in a place sheltered from rain.




## Chopping wood and storage
