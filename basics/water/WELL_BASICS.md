# Well
One of the most common way of getting fresh drinking water at the mokki, is to have a well.

A well is just an excavation or structure in the ground to access water, and they can
be broadly classified into one of two categories

* Shallow well (or unconfined) - If you ever dug a hole in a sandy beach, you might
have reached a point when water starts accumulating at the bottom. This is how shallow
wells work. These wells get their water from unconfined aquifers closer to the surface.
The water from rain, lakes, rivers and sea permeates the soil, creating
a layer of water saturated soil. Once a well is dug bellow the water level a pool of water
will accumulate.

* Deep wells (or confined) - If the region you're in does not have any body of water nearby, is
too high above wate level, or does not have a layer of soil to retain the water, it's likely
that no unconfined aquifer exists. However it is possible that deeper, confined aquifers exist.
These underground bodies of water, somtimes the size of countires, can be accessed with deeper
excavations.
