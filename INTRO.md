# Background
I have arrived to Finland in mid-2014. I came as an exchange student but, similarly to many other expatriates, one thing lead to another resulting in me making Finland my home country .

Among the things that tied me to this amazing country, is my fascination for Mökki elämää (Cottage life) and the nature surrounding it.

However, unlike native Finns, I did not have the privilege of growing up in such environment. Never before I had setup sauna, picked mushrooms and berries in the forest, fish in the lakes, or driven a motor boat. I was(am) basically a child fascinated about everything new, and the amount of new things to learn.

This "book" is both a personal registry of how to do things, but also a way of sharing with others the amazing world of the Finnish cottage and its surroundings. Specially to foreigners moving to Finland, who will find limited resources available.
